Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This repository contains the assignment files for the Getting and Cleaning Datacourse of Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera
Data

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The data is automatically downloaded once the run_analysis.R script is ran.
Files

This repository contains four files required for the assignment to be graded:

    README.md - Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
    CodeBook.md - Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
    run_analysis.R - R-script that performs the analysis on the data retrieved from
    run_analysis.Rmd containing the tidy data which is created by running the run_analysis.R file
